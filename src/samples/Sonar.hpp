/** Representation of the data acquired by a sonar
 *
 * The data structure can be used to represent data from both mechanical
 * scanning and multibeam sonars. Let's see now the most common use-cases for
 * the structure
 *
 * In the mechanical-scanning sonar case, one would usually create one structure
 * per beam. The fromBeam helper can be used to create and initialize the
 * structure easily:
 *
 * @code
 * Sonar single_beam = Sonar::fromBeam(timestamp, bins, bearing);
 * @endcode
 *
 * In the multibeam case, one would initialize the structure and then fill it
 * with beams
 *
 * @code
 * Sonar multibeam(timestamp, bin_count);
 * for (int i = 0; i < bin_count; ++i)
 *    multibeam.pushBeam(bin_data_for_beam_i);
 * multibeam.setRegularBeamBearings(start_bearing, interval_bearing);
 * @encode
 *
 * A scanning sonar that would happen to be static can also have its beams
 * "aggregated" in a single structure, for instance if some multibeam-specific
 * algorithm can be used to process it. In this case, one timestamp should be
 * provided by beam, and a 'global' timestamp usually will need to be picked
 * in order for e.g. the stream aligner to work.
 *
 * @code
 * Sonar static_scanning_sonar(timestamp, bin_count);
 * for (int i = 0; i < bin_count; ++i)
 *    multibeam.pushBeam(time_for_beam_i, bin_data_for_beam_i);
 * multibeam.setRegularBeamBearings(start_bearing, interval_bearing);
 * @encode
